How big data is stored
The need to handle big data speeds imposes unique requirements on the basic computing infrastructure. The computing power required to process huge amounts and different types of data can quickly overwhelm a single server or server group. Organizations must implement sufficient processing capacity for big data tasks in order to achieve the required speed. This can require hundreds or thousands of servers that can distribute processing work and work collaboratively in a clustered architecture, often relying on technologies like Hadoop and Apache Spark.
Achieving such speed in a cost-effective manner is also a challenge. Many corporate leaders are keen to invest in a large-scale server and storage infrastructure to support big data workloads, especially those that do not work around the clock 24/7. As a result, public cloud computing has now become an essential means of hosting big data systems. A public cloud provider can store petabytes of data and increase the required number of servers for long enough to complete the Big Data Analytics project. The company only pays for the storage time and account actually used, and instances of the cloud can be turned off until they are needed again.
To further improve service levels, public cloud providers offer significant data capabilities through managed services that include: Amazon EMR (formerly known as MapReduce) Microsoft Azure HDInsight Google Dataproc In cloud environments, big data can be stored in the following: Hadoop file system  Distributed (HDFS);  Low-cost cloud object storage, such as Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3);  NoSQL databases and relational databases.  For organizations wishing to deploy domestic big data systems, commonly used open source Apache technologies in addition to Hadoop and Spark include: YARN, the resource manager built into Hadoop scheduling and job scheduling, which symbolizes another resource negotiator but is known only in short.  MapReduce framework, which is also a key component of Hadoop;  Kafka, a messaging and data flow platform from application to application;  HBase database;  And SQL-on-Hadoop search engines, such as Drill, Hive, Impala, and Presto.
Users can install open source versions of the technologies themselves or switch to commercial big data platforms offered by Cloudera, which merged with its former rival Hortonworks in January 2019, or Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE), which purchased MapR Technologies' big data seller assets in August 2019. Cloudera and MapR platforms are also supported in the cloud.
Big data has found many applications in various fields today.  The main areas where big data is used are as follows.
  Government
  Big data analyzes have proven to be extremely beneficial in the government sector.  Big Data Analysis played a big role in Barack Obama's successful re-election campaign for 2012. Also recently, Big Data was heavily responsible for Bharatiya Janata Party and its allies to win the very successful Indian General Election 2014. The Indian government uses many techniques to make sure  Indian voters response to government actions, as well as increased policy ideas.
  Social media analytics
  The rise of social media led to the explosion of big data.  Several solutions have been created for social media activity analysis such as IBM Cognos Consumer Insights, which is a point solution that works on IBM's BigInsights Big Data platform, which can make sense of chatter.  Social media can provide valuable insights in real time about how the market responds to products and campaigns.  With the help of these statistics, companies can adjust pricing, promotion and campaign placements accordingly.  Before using big data, some pre-processing of big data must be done in order to get some smart and valuable results.  Hence, it is necessary to know the consumer mindset to apply smart decisions derived from big data.
  Technique
  Big data technology applications consist of the following companies that handle massive amounts of data every day and put it in use for business decisions as well.  For example, eBay.com uses 7.5-bit and 40-bit data warehouses in addition to the 40PB Hadoop suite of research, consumer recommendations, and marketing.  Inside eBay's 90PB data warehouse.  Amazon.com handles millions of back-end operations every day, plus inquiries from more than half a million third-party vendors.  The core technology that keeps Amazon running is based on Linux, and as of 2005 they had the three largest Linux databases in the world, with capacities of 7.8 terabytes, 18.5 terabytes and 24.7 terabytes.  Facebook processes 50 billion photos from its user base.  Windermere Real Estate uses anonymous GPS signals from nearly 100 million drivers to help new home buyers define typical driving times to and from work throughout different times of the day.
  Detecting fraud
  For companies whose operations include any type of claim or transaction processing, fraud detection is one of the most compelling examples of big data application.  Historically, the detection of flight fraud has proven to be a distant goal.  In most cases, fraud is discovered long after the accident has occurred, at which point the damage is all that remains is to reduce the damage and adjust policies to prevent it from happening again.  Big data platforms that can analyze claims and transactions in real-time, define broad patterns across multiple transactions or discover abnormal behavior from an individual user, can change the fraud detection game.
