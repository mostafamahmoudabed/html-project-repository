When you tweet or post a picture on instagram  ,where do they go ?
You would say they are saved data bases of course .correct but after they are saved where do they go ? maybe you never thought about it .what is certain is that this data does not  go in a drawer nor does it turn into achieves today . there are no achieves a little things are used for a specific purpose and are no longer little stuff they are now called big data . for thousands of years man has been to record details and events of his life in various ways like drawing on caves walls and engraving symbols in stones until he reached writing what kind of writing? Frist on paper and now in cyberspace in the past . we used to store information on floppy disks To Transfer from Computer to Another later on we started using CDs and after that hard disks .  and kept on progressing till we reached the time of flash memory   and today we have reached the era of cloud storage which is storing information somewhere on the internet like dropbox ,iCloud  google drive and many other sites that have become our personal storage boxes . but they are neither in our homes nor on our phones but a large farms of giant computers containing huge storing space this has given us the ability to reach information at any moment and from anywhere and this has enable companies to know all about our personal lives and know about us even more than our families and friends    Eric Schmidt, google`s  CEO . explains the big data fhenomenon in a nice and  concise way . he says that mankind , since the dawn of time and up until 2003  has produced 5 billion gigabytes of data in forms of images, documents ,music ,books and others however in 2011, 5 billions gigabytes of data was produced in gust 2 days and in 2013 , 5 billions of data was produced every 10 minutes. Before the internet government and private sector employees were the most to produce ,store and analyse data they consisted of  financial documents paperwork , personal files and many other 


things about clients , buying and selling . but today the most data producers in the world are regular people ,like us old and young and contributing in this huge data accumulation
